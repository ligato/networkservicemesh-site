Throughout this documentation, we make reference to **L2**/**L3** networking in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) as the technological focus of Network Service Mesh. In this document, we provide a basic, non-comprehensive [primer](#osi) on the seven-layer [Open Systems Interconnected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) (OSI) networking model

## The OSI model {#osi}

In the OSI model, the modern networking "stack" consists of seven layers (**L1** through **L7**). Each layer serves the layer above it and is in turn served by the layer below (thus L4, for example, serves L5 and is served by L3).

The seven OSI networking layers are explained in the table below (with L2 and L3 highlighted with a light gray background and a larger font).

## L2/L3

As you can see from the table above, Network Service Mesh provides network functionality on layers **2** and **3**.

## L4-L7

As it stands, [Kubernetes networking](https://sookocheff.com/post/kubernetes/understanding-kubernetes-networking-model) involves L4 through L7 only. The basic networking "contracts" provided by Kubernetes are defined by the [Container Network Interface](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) specification, for example how traffic is routed between [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/), how Pods discover one another, how [namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) are handled at the network level, etc. Networking tools for Kubernetes like [Calico](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v2.0/getting-started/kubernetes/) and [Weave Net](https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/overview/) are CNI compliant.

Network Service Mesh is a *complement* to CNI and the existing Kubernetes networking stack, *not* a replacement for it. **NSM seeks to provide new capabilities to Kubernetes that are not defined by the CNI specification**.
