Throughout this documentation, we make reference to **L2**/**L3** networking  as the technological focus of Network Service Mesh. In this document, we provide a basic, non-comprehensive [primer](#osi) on the seven-layer [Open Systems Interconnected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) (OSI) networking model, so that readers can more readily separate Network Service Mesh's L2/L3 terrain from the L4-L7 terrain covered by other [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) networking technologies.

## The OSI model {#osi}

In the OSI model, the modern networking "stack" consists of seven layers (**L1** through **L7**). Each layer makes the layer above it possible and in relies on the layer below it to exist (L4, for example, enables L5 to exist but could not exist without L3).

The seven OSI networking layers are summarized in the table below (L2 and L3 have a light gray background and a larger font).

## Kubernetes and L4-L7

The essential networking "contracts" provided by Kubernetes are defined by the [Container Network Interface](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) specification. These contracts pertain, for example, to how traffic is routed between [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/), how Pods discover one another, how [namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) are handled at the network level, and so on.

Networking tools for Kubernetes like [Calico](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v2.0/getting-started/kubernetes/) and [Weave Net](https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/overview/) are CNI compliant and thus involve L4 through L7 only.

Network Service Mesh is a *complement* to CNI and the existing Kubernetes networking stack, *not* a replacement for it. In other words, **NSM seeks to provide services running on Kubernetes with new capabilities that are not defined by the CNI specification**.
