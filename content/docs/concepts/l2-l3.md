Throughout this documentation, we make reference to **L2**/**L3** networking in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) as the technological focus of Network Service Mesh. In this document, we provide a basic, non-comprehensive primer on the [Open Systems Interconnected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) (OSI) networking model

## The OSI model

In the OSI model, the modern networking "stack" consists of seven layers (**L1** through **L7**). Each layer serves the layer above it and is in turn served by the layer below (thus L4, for example, serves L5 and is served by L3).

### The seven layers

The seven OSI networking layers are explained in the table below (with L2 and L3 highlighted with a light gray background and a larger font).
