# Why Attend NSMCon?
{{< img-text img="/img/events/NSMCon1.png">}}
Are you running workloads in multiple clusters? Across multiple clouds: on-premises, hybrid, multi-cloud, or public cloud? Do they need to interact with legacy workloads running in less “cloudy” environments? Network Service Mesh (NSM) ties them all together, at the granularity of individual workloads, not clusters/VPCs/data centers. 

NSM, a community-driven CNCF Sandbox project, is rapidly gaining momentum because simplifies connectivity between workloads, independent of where they run. It extends an IP reachability domain to workloads running in multiple clusters, legacy environments, on-premises, or in a public cloud, communicating with the existing protocols.

NSM does this at the granularity of individual workloads. Your workloads have connectivity to just the workloads they need - nothing more, nothing less. NSM brings the useful features of a Service Mesh from the lofty heights of HTTP all the way down to IP itself. Applications and Application Service Meshes, such as Istio, run unaltered on top, leaving the hybrid/multicloud IP connectivity to NSM.

The project emerged organically as a community project to solve these problems by applying the Service Mesh thought process all the way down to IP with the global peering mentality of the Internet itself – without breaking your existing environment.

Join the people building and using NSM at Network Service Mesh Con for a day of tutorials, deep dives, and use cases to learn how NSM works, what it can do for you, and, most importantly, what’s coming next.
