# Schedule

Monday Nov 18, 2019 | San Diego, California

{{% talk time="09:15am" title="NSM, a network noob's point of view" %}}
The Network Service Mesh advertises itself as a novel approach to complex networking. 
This statement is just as intriguing as it is vague! This talk will shed light on NSM by 
providing clear, tangible definitions and explanations of virtual wires, network service 
endpoints, network services and NSM's architecture from a network noob's point of view. 
Together we shall arrive at an accurate, actionable mental model of NSM, what it is and 
how it works.

Trying to understand the service mesh strata? Brace yourself. It gets a bit meshy. Data plane, 
control plane, and a… management plane. What is a management plane and how is it different 
than a control plane?

Learn how Meshery, an open source, multi-service mesh management plane integrates with 
Network Service Mesh as we discuss and demonstrate their complimentary architecture. As a 
multi-mesh management plane, Meshery manages the lifecycle of NSM, providing insight into its 
CNFs while facilitating benchmarking of various configuration scenarios of 
Network Service Mesh.

See how these three service mesh planes combine to facilitate performance comparisons of 
services (applications) on and off the mesh and across different meshes. Understand the caveats 
of onboarding your applications onto a service mesh as Meshery validates best practices 
configuration of NSM and its CNFs.

{{% talk time="10:30am" title="Network Service Mesh + SDN for Application Quality of Experience" %}}
Telcos, ISPs, and enterprises are looking to adopt cloud-native solutions in the face of industry transitions to NFV, 
5G, edge computing, IoT, and multi-cloud connectivity. Network Service Mesh facilitates the move to cloud-native by 
providing a toolset for containerized applications to take advantage of advanced networking capabilities.  In this 
session, Bruce McDougall and Zia Syed will present and demonstrate an NSM solution which enables container-based 
applications to request their own network "Quality of Experience". The solution itself is an integration of NSM with 
the team’s microservices-based SDN system nicknamed “Voltron”.  The combination allows NSM to offer services such as 
traffic engineering, path steering, or even virtual topology creation to containerized applications with use cases 
spanning 5G, network slicing, and next-gen VPNs.

{{% talk time="11:30am" title="Building upon NSM to create inter-cluster private L3 networks" %}}
The NSM inter-domain feature adds the ability for NSM to create connections between clients and network service 
endpoints in different NSM domains, e.g. Kubernetes clusters.  Building upon this capability, it’s possible to create 
network service endpoints that dynamically form a common private L3 routing domain to interconnect workloads hosted in 
multiple NSM domains.  This presentation and demo will explore an example implementation of a virtual L3 network 
service endpoint, the NSM inter-domain deployment, and resulting dataplane connectivity details across multiple 
Kubernetes clusters.  We will discuss the integration of existing application service mesh L4-L7 features with 
the virtual L3 NSE to highlight the simplifications in the application admin experience.

{{% talk time="01:00pm" title="How SMI inspired NSM traffic observability" %}}
NSM effort was launched in order to address gaps in handling complicated L2 and L3 use cases. Now celebrating its 1st 
release, the project can be proud of a pretty stable state and a wide variety of features. It came to a point where 
it needs to focus on integrating solutions and increasing easy adoption and observability. Meanwhile, given that 
Service Mesh is a hot topic with different competing implementations on the cloud native landscape, the open source 
project SMI was born with broad industry support to unite all efforts in this area under a common specification. 
Starting with the idea to adopt SMI for the non-standard  L2/L3 use cases that NSM covers, the outcome turned out to 
be bigger than expected, reflecting in an improvement of the traffic observability - an important step forward the 
project usability. In this session we will introduce details around the SMI adoption and the practical results of the 
community efforts in the direction of increasing monitoring capabilities.

{{% talk time="01:30pm" title="I hear you like meshes, here’s a mesh to connect your meshes" %}}
There are many application service mesh related projects (Istio, Linkerd, SMI, etc.).  Network Service Mesh (NSM) 
aims to solve a slightly different problem.  Used together they are immensely powerful.   NSM can be used to solve 
microservice specific multicloud connectivity issues, but even with that connectivity, application service mesh 
integration doesn’t come for free.  Application service mesh solutions are great in single cloud environments but 
become unwieldy or unusable across multiple environments.  In this talk and demo we will show an NSM multicloud 
application connectivity solution with Istio integration to provide the control, security and observability 
applications require ACROSS multiple clouds.  We will demo Istio service discovery working with NSM connected 
workloads.  Envoy with form an application service mesh on top of the network mesh created by NSM.  This will allow 
Istio to provide seamless control over microservices regardless of how they are connected.

{{% talk time="02:30pm" title="Composing Hybrid Service Chains in the CNF Testbed with NSM" %}}
This is the community journey of bringing together Cloud Native Network Functions (CNFs) and Virtual Networking 
Functions (VNF) using Network Service Mesh (NSM) to facilitate policy-driven, declarative and on-demand L2/L3 network 
use cases in the CNF Testbed.

The CNF Testbed initiative provides a vendor-neutral space to explore and evaluate open source networking technologies 
and their interoperability, in addition to fostering collaboration between the various projects and communities.

A hybrid use case running across OpenStack and Kubernetes (K8s) will be shown. The former will represent the 
traditional and established Networking Function Virtualization concepts, where an application is run in a virtual 
machine called a VNF. The K8s cluster will demonstrate CNFs. NSM is used to stitch all of the connections together 
from container to container, container to VM and cluster to cluster.

# Why Attend NSMCon?
{{< img-text img="/img/events/NSMCon1.png">}}
Are you running workloads in multiple clusters? Across multiple clouds: on-premises, hybrid, multicloud, or public cloud? Do they need to interact with legacy workloads running in less “cloudy” environments? Network Service Mesh (NSM) ties them all together, at the granularity of individual workloads, not cluster/VPCs/data centers. 

NSM is a community-driven CNCF Sandbox project that is rapidly gaining momentum because of its ability to simplify connectivity between workloads, independent of where they are running. It extends an IP reachability domain to workloads running in multiple clusters, legacy environments, on-premises, or in a public cloud, communicating with the protocols they are currently using.

NSM does this at the granularity of individual workloads. Your workloads have connectivity to just the workloads they need nothing more, nothing less. NSM brings the useful features of a Service Mesh from the lofty heights of HTTP all the way down to IP itself. Applications and Application Service Meshes, such as Istio, run unaltered on top, leaving the hybrid/multicloud IP connectivity to NSM.

The project emerged organically as a community project to solve these problems by applying the Service Mesh thought process all the way down to IP with the global peering mentality of the Internet itself – without breaking your existing environment.

Join the people building and using NSM at Network Service Mesh Con for a day of tutorials, deep dives, and use cases to learn how NSM works, what it can do for you, and, most importantly, what’s coming next.
